## API

The task was to design a set of base APIs mirroring Practo.

## Dependencies

```
django
django-rest-framework
django-filter

```

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
``` 

## Description

- Doctor APIs for adding,listing,filtering and searching based on locality and their speciality
- Interaction API basically for liking and un-liking a Doctor
- An availability API for knowing if the doctor is available for appointment


The admin route is enables for creating and updating users

Decided to use `django-rest-framework` and `django-filter` for it's robust and easy to use structure because of the time constraint.

`django-rest-framework`s Viewsets helps in enabling GET-POST-PUT-DELETE APIs in an instant
